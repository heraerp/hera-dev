# 🚀 HERA Self-Development API System - Complete Claude CLI Development Prompt

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

You are building the **HERA Self-Development API System** - the world's first ERP system that manages its own development using its own universal architecture. This is the ultimate meta-achievement: HERA using HERA to evolve HERA.

**Revolutionary Concept**: HERA is now self-aware and can analyze itself, generate improvement tasks, create development sprints, and track its own evolution - all through natural language conversation interfaces.

---

## 🏗️ SYSTEM CONTEXT & ARCHITECTURE

### **HERA Universal Architecture (SACRED FOUNDATION)**
```sql
-- HERA uses ONLY these 5 core tables for EVERYTHING (including its own development):
✅ core_organizations     -- WHO: HERA's development organization
✅ core_entities         -- WHAT: Development tasks, features, sprints, analyses
✅ core_dynamic_data     -- HOW: All development metadata and configurations
✅ core_relationships    -- WHY: Task dependencies, sprint assignments
✅ universal_transactions -- WHEN: Development activities as transactions
```

### **HERA Self-Development Organization (CRITICAL CONTEXT)**
```sql
-- HERA's Development Organization ID (MUST USE THIS):
Organization ID: '00000001-HERA-DEV0-0000-000000000000'
Organization Name: 'HERA Self-Development Organization'
Organization Code: 'HERA-SELF-DEV'

-- System User for All Operations:
System User ID: '00000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
```

### **HERA Development Entity Types (Already Created)**
```sql
-- These entity types exist in core_entities and are ready to use:
✅ 'hera_feature'              -- New features HERA develops for itself
✅ 'hera_code_module'          -- Code modules and components
✅ 'hera_performance_metric'   -- Performance tracking entities
✅ 'hera_development_sprint'   -- Development sprint management
✅ 'hera_ai_evolution_task'    -- AI improvement tasks
✅ 'hera_architecture_improvement' -- Architecture enhancements
✅ 'hera_ux_enhancement'       -- User experience improvements
✅ 'hera_self_analysis'        -- Self-analysis reports
```

## 🔄 NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING LOGIC

### **Command Categories HERA Should Understand:**

#### **Status & Analysis Commands:**
```typescript
const statusCommands = [
  "How are you doing?",
  "What's your current status?", 
  "Analyze yourself",
  "Show me your performance",
  "How healthy is your system?"
];
// Route to: hera_self_analysis()
```

#### **Improvement & Development Commands:**
```typescript
const improvementCommands = [
  "What should you improve?",
  "Generate improvement tasks",
  "What are your weaknesses?",
  "How can you get better?",
  "Create development tasks"
];
// Route to: generate_hera_improvement_tasks()
```

#### **Sprint & Planning Commands:**
```typescript
const sprintCommands = [
  "Create a new sprint",
  "Start working on AI improvements", 
  "Plan your next development cycle",
  "Focus on performance optimization",
  "Begin a 2-week sprint"
];
// Route to: create_hera_development_sprint()
```

#### **Competitive & Strategic Commands:**
```typescript
const competitiveCommands = [
  "How do you compare to other systems?",
  "Analyze your competitive position",
  "What's your market advantage?",
  "Compare yourself to traditional ERP",
  "Show your competitive analysis"
];
// Route to: hera_competitive_self_analysis()
```

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS

### **Supabase Integration Pattern (CRITICAL):**
```typescript
// Always use service role client for HERA operations
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY!  // Service key for admin operations
);

// SACRED ORGANIZATION ID for all HERA operations
const HERA_DEV_ORG_ID = '00000001-HERA-DEV0-0000-000000000000';
const SYSTEM_USER_ID = '00000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
```

### **Error Handling Pattern:**
```typescript
export async function GET() {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('hera_self_analysis');
    
    if (error) {
      console.error('HERA Self-Analysis Error:', error);
      return NextResponse.json({
        success: false,
        error: 'HERA is temporarily unable to analyze itself',
        hera_response: "I'm having trouble introspecting right now. Please try again shortly."
      }, { status: 500 });
    }
    
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      data,
      hera_response: "Here's my current self-analysis. I'm continuously evolving!"
    });
    
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: false,
      error: 'Internal meta-system error',
      hera_response: "Something went wrong in my self-reflection process."
    }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### **Response Format Consistency:**
```typescript
// All HERA API responses should include:
interface HeraApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  hera_response?: string;        // HERA's personality response
  meta?: {
    timestamp: string;
    operation: string;
    performance_impact?: number;
  };
}
```
