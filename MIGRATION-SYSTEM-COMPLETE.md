## 🎯 Revolutionary Features

### 🧠 AI-Powered Intelligence
```typescript
// AI analyzes menu complexity and generates insights
const insights = await migrationService.generateInsights(menuData)
// Returns: complexity analysis, revenue optimization, compliance warnings
```

### ⚡ One-Click Migration
```typescript
// Complete migration with single function call
const result = await migrationService.migrateMenu({
  menuData: uploadedFile,
  restaurantName: 'Spice Garden',
  cuisineTypes: ['indian', 'lebanese'],
  organizationId: 'user-org-id'
})
// Result: 37 items migrated, 8 categories created, 96% validation score
```

### 📊 Real-Time Validation
```typescript
// Live validation with enterprise-grade scoring
const validation = result.validation
// Returns: entity compliance, naming compliance, GL code compliance, warnings, errors
```

### 💡 Intelligent GL Mapping
```typescript
// AI automatically assigns GL codes with confidence scoring
const glMapping = {
  'MEZZE & APPETIZERS': { code: '4100-FOOD-APPETIZERS', confidence: 0.96 },
  'CURRIES & MAIN COURSES': { code: '4110-FOOD-MAINS', confidence: 0.94 },
  'BEVERAGES': { code: '4200-BEVERAGES', confidence: 0.98 }
}
```
