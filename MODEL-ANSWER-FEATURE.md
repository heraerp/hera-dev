```typescript
const generateModelAnswer = (question: Question, techniqueAdvice: ExamTechniqueAdvice): string => {
  // Detects question content and marks to provide perfect answer
  if (questionText.includes('limited company')) {
    return `Two features of a limited company are:
    
    1. **Limited liability** - Shareholders are only responsible for company debts up to the amount they have invested in shares. This means their personal assets are protected if the company fails.
    
    2. **Separate legal entity** - The company has its own legal identity separate from its owners. This allows the company to enter into contracts, own assets, and be sued in its own name.
    
    **Examiner Note**: Each point clearly states the feature and explains what it means in practice. No examples needed for a 2-mark "state" question.`;
  }

## 🌟 **SAMPLE MODEL ANSWERS**

### **2-Mark Question Example**
```
Two features of a limited company are:

1. **Limited liability** - Shareholders are only responsible for company debts up to the amount they have invested in shares.

2. **Separate legal entity** - The company has its own legal identity separate from its owners.

**Examiner Note**: Each point clearly states the feature and explains what it means in practice. No examples needed for a 2-mark "state" question.
```

### **6-Mark Question Example**  
```
Two advantages of franchising for a franchisor are:

**1. Rapid expansion with reduced risk**
Franchising allows the franchisor to expand their business quickly across multiple locations without having to invest their own capital in each new outlet. For example, McDonald's has expanded globally through franchising without having to fund every restaurant directly.

**2. Local market knowledge and management**  
Franchisees typically have better knowledge of their local market conditions, customer preferences, and regulations. For instance, a local franchisee would understand regional food preferences better than a distant head office.

**Examiner Note**: Each advantage is clearly explained with reasoning (why it's beneficial) and includes a relevant business example. This follows the PEE structure: Point → Explanation → Example.
```
