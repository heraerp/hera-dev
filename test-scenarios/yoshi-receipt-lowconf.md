- **Issues**:
  - Handwritten, partially illegible
  - Crumpled paper, poor scan quality
  - Vendor not in main system
  - No PO reference (emergency purchase)
  - Amount written in different ink

## Document Details (What Human Can Read)
- **Vendor**: Bob-omb's Feed & Supply  
- **Date**: 1/17/2024 (handwritten)
- **Items**: 
  - Emergency hay bales (quantity unclear)
  - Yoshi egg feed supplement
  - Rush delivery charge
- **Total**: $347.50 (or $347.56? unclear)
