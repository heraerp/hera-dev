# 👤 **USER PROFILE & DEBUGGING FEATURES ADDED**

## 🎯 **Problem Addressed**

You requested to see which user is trying to access the restaurant dashboard because you couldn't see your user profile anywhere and were getting "No Restaurant Found" errors.

## ✅ **Features Added**

### **1. User Profile Display in Error State**
When you see "No Restaurant Found", the page now shows:

```

### **3. User Profile in Dashboard Header**
When the dashboard works properly, you'll see your user profile in the top-right corner:

```

```

### **4. Interactive Debugging Tools**

**🔄 Refresh & Retry Button** - Reloads the page to retry restaurant loading

- **The specific error message**

## 📊 **Expected Debug Output**

Based on our previous investigation, you should see something like:

```
