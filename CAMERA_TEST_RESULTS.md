### 4. Camera Flow Simulation ✅
```
📱 Camera Capture     → ✅ Image captured (base64 encoded)
☁️  Receipt Upload     → ✅ Stored in core_entities 
🤖 AI Processing      → ✅ 92% confidence extraction
💳 Transaction Create → ✅ Stored in universal_transactions
📊 Full Audit Trail   → ✅ All data linked via core_relationships
```

## 🔧 **MINOR ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

### Auto-Transaction Creation
- **Issue**: Vendor lookup in auto-creation logic not finding exact matches
- **Impact**: Transactions need manual creation instead of automatic  
- **Workaround**: Manual transaction creation works perfectly
- **Status**: Non-blocking for camera demo
