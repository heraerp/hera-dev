üéØ MASTER PROMPT: Restaurant Management App Frontend
World-Class Claude CLI Prompt for Building the Ultimate Restaurant Interface
Combining Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think" usability with Sean Adams' restaurant-specific color psychology and HERA's universal data architecture

This isn't just another restaurant app - it's the interface that makes complex restaurant operations feel as simple as ordering your morning coffee.

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
- "3-Second Rule": Staff must understand any screen within 3 seconds
- "Greasy Finger Proof": Works perfectly on dirty, splashed tablets
- "Universal Language": Uses colors and icons that mean the same thing globally
- "Fatigue Resistant": Comfortable to use during 12-hour shifts
- "Mistake Proof": Dangerous actions are visually distinct from safe ones

TECHNICAL FOUNDATION:
- Built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Uses HERA's 5-table universal data architecture
- Responsive design that works on any device
- Real-time updates with Supabase
- Optimized for restaurant environments (lighting, noise, urgency)

DATABASE STRUCTURE (Your foundation):
1. core_entities (everything is an entity)
2. core_dynamic_data (flexible properties)
3. core_organizations (restaurant details)
4. core_users (staff and customers)
5. ai_schema_registry (AI learns patterns)

SEAN ADAMS COLOR SYSTEM:
- Foundation: Clean whites (#FEFEFE) and warm grays (#57534E)
- Success: Professional green (#16A34A) - "Go, Complete, Good"
- Warning: Amber (#F59E0B) - "Caution, Pending, Attention"
