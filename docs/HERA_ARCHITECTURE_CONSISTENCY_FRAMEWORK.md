# HERA Universal Architecture Consistency Framework
## Automated Enforcement of HERA Principles Across All Development

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **OVERVIEW**

The **HERA Universal Architecture Consistency Framework** is a revolutionary self-enforcing system that automatically ensures all development follows HERA principles and prevents architectural violations. It's the world's first **Self-Protecting Architecture** that maintains its own integrity through automated validation, code review, and enforcement mechanisms.

## üîí **SACRED RULES REGISTRY**

### **The Five Sacred Rules of HERA Architecture**

1. **SACRED: Universal Schema Core Tables Only Rule**
   - ALL functionality must use only HERA Universal Core Tables
   - No custom table creation allowed - ever
   - Violation Detection: `CREATE TABLE` statements outside approved list
   - Auto-Correction: Suggest `core_entities` with `entity_type` alternative

2. **SACRED: Organization-ID Multi-Tenancy Rule**
   - EVERY query must include `organization_id` filter as first WHERE clause
   - Violation Detection: SELECT without `organization_id`
   - Auto-Correction: Add `WHERE organization_id = ?` automatically
   - Pattern: `WHERE organization_id = ? AND ...`

3. **SACRED: Universal Naming Convention Rule**
   - All fields must follow `[entity]_[attribute]` pattern for AI understanding
   - Violation Detection: Generic names without entity prefix
   - Auto-Correction: Suggest entity-prefixed alternatives
   - Examples: `org_name`, `user_email`, `product_price`

4. **SACRED: No Custom Tables Rule**
   - Use universal tables instead of business-specific schemas
   - Violation Detection: Non-universal table creation
   - Auto-Correction: Map to `core_entities` with appropriate `entity_type`

5. **SACRED: AI-Native Design Rule**
   - Intelligence and templates built into core architecture
   - Violation Detection: Manual processes that could be AI-automated
   - Auto-Correction: Suggest AI-powered alternatives

## ü§ñ **AUTOMATED VALIDATION FUNCTIONS**

### **Real-Time Architecture Compliance Checker**

```sql
-- Validate any SQL statement for HERA compliance
SELECT validate_hera_architecture_compliance(
    'SELECT * FROM custom_products WHERE name = ''test''',
    'development'
);

-- Returns:
{
  "is_compliant": false,
  "compliance_score": 50,
  "violations": [
    {
      "rule_code": "HERA-RULE-001",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "message": "VIOLATION: Custom table creation detected",
      "suggestion": "Use core_entities with entity_type instead",
      "auto_fix_available": true
    }
  ],
  "hera_architecture_status": "CRITICAL_VIOLATIONS"
}
```

### **Automated Code Review System**

```sql
-- Review TypeScript/JavaScript code for HERA compliance
SELECT hera_automated_code_review(
    'const data = localStorage.getItem("user");',
    'javascript'
);

-- Returns:
{
  "compliance_score": 70,
  "grade": "C",
  "hera_compliant": false,
  "issues": [
    {
      "type": "PLATFORM_VIOLATION",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "message": "localStorage not supported in Claude artifacts",
      "fix": "Use React state (useState/useReducer) instead"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Development Pattern Templates**

```sql
-- Get HERA-compliant development patterns
SELECT get_hera_development_patterns('api_route');

-- Returns complete template with:
-- - HERA Universal API Route Pattern
-- - Sacred rules embedded
-- - Error handling
-- - Organization ID validation
```

---

## üìä **COMPLIANCE DASHBOARD**

### **Real-Time Metrics**

```sql
-- Get comprehensive compliance dashboard
SELECT get_hera_compliance_dashboard();
```

**Dashboard Includes:**
- **Overall Compliance Score**: 85% (Good)
- **Functions Compliant**: 128/150 (85%)
- **Queries Compliant**: 135/150 (90%)
- **Sacred Rules Adherence**:
  - Universal Core Tables Only: 95%
  - Organization ID Isolation: 80%
  - Naming Conventions: 75%

## üéì **DEVELOPER CERTIFICATION SYSTEM**

### **HERA Architecture Certification Quiz**

```sql
-- Take the official HERA certification quiz
SELECT hera_architecture_certification_quiz(
    'developer-uuid',
    '{"q1": "Use core_entities with entity_type", "q2": "organization_id filter first"}'::jsonb
);
```

**Certification Levels:**
- **HERA_MASTER** (9-10 correct): Mentor others, contribute to documentation
- **HERA_EXPERT** (7-8 correct): Build HERA applications, advanced training
- **HERA_COMPETENT** (5-6 correct): Basic HERA development with supervision
- **HERA_LEARNING** (0-4 correct): Requires additional training before development

### **Certification Benefits**
- Access to advanced HERA development patterns
- Authorization to review other developers' code
- Contribution rights to HERA documentation
- Priority support for complex architectural questions

---

## üö® **ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS**

### **Event Triggers (Database Level)**

```sql
-- Prevent custom table creation automatically
CREATE EVENT TRIGGER hera_prevent_custom_tables
    ON ddl_command_end
    WHEN TAG IN ('CREATE TABLE')
    EXECUTE FUNCTION prevent_custom_table_creation();
```

**What It Does:**
- Monitors all DDL commands in real-time
- Blocks custom table creation outside HERA universal schema
- Provides educational error messages with alternatives
- Logs all violations for compliance reporting

### **Pre-Commit Hooks (Code Level)**

```bash
# Git pre-commit hook integration
#!/bin/bash
# Check all modified files for HERA compliance
for file in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM); do
    if [[ $file =~ \.(ts|js|sql)$ ]]; then
        hera-compliance-check "$file"
    fi
done
```

### **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
- name: HERA Compliance Check
  run: |
    # Scan all code for HERA violations
    hera-scanner --fail-on-critical
    # Generate compliance report
    hera-report --format=github-comment
```
